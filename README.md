# cozee-launcher
A bad launcher i made for my server and now its open source for people learning C#

**This code may be bad but you can learn from it**

**Credits :**
<br/>
Cranium.dll ( SSL bypasser ) made by Sizzy
cozee.dll ( play button listener ) made by me and nax
Console.dll ( UniversalFNConsole ) made by notsamicc
Lawinserver made by lawin#0001

The interface is bad but you can learn from LaunchFN.cs for launching game
<br/> 
ProcessExtension.cs class made because basic process.suspend(); not working
